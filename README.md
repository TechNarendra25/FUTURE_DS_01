Business Sales Dashboard from E-commerce Data

üìù Project Overview

This project features a professional and interactive business sales dashboard created with Power BI. It's based on the "Data Science & Analytics Task 1" from Future Interns. The primary goal is to analyze a large e-commerce dataset to extract actionable insights that can help business owners and decision-makers understand sales performance, product trends, and customer behavior.

The final dashboard is available in the Task1.pbix file in this repository.

‚ùì Key Questions Answered

The dashboard was designed to provide clear answers to critical business questions:

What are the best-selling products?

When do sales peak during the year?

Which categories or regions bring in the most revenue?

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

Power BI Desktop: Used for data modeling, analysis (DAX), and creating the interactive dashboard.

Power Query: Utilized within Power BI for the entire Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process.


DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Employed to create complex measures and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).


Microsoft Excel: Used for initial data inspection and basic formatting.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

Data Sourcing: The project utilized one of the sample e-commerce datasets provided by Kaggle, as per the task requirements.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Using Power Query, the raw data was meticulously cleaned. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and structuring the data into a clean, usable format for analysis.

Data Modeling & Analysis: A relational model was built within Power BI. Key measures and KPIs like Total Sales, Profit Margin, and Sales by Region were created using DAX to power the visuals.

Dashboard Development: A multi-page interactive dashboard was designed. It includes a variety of visuals like bar charts, line charts, maps, and slicers, allowing for dynamic filtering and drill-down to explore the data from multiple perspectives.

üí° Key Insights & Recommendations
(The following are sample insights. The full, interactive findings are available in the .pbix file.)

Top Performing Categories: The dashboard reveals that the 'Technology' product category is the highest revenue generator, while the 'Office Supplies' category has the highest sales volume.

Sales Seasonality: Time series analysis clearly indicates that sales peak during the holiday season in November and December. A smaller, secondary peak occurs around mid-year, suggesting a seasonal promotion opportunity.

Regional Performance: The dashboard highlights that specific regions consistently outperform others in both sales and profitability, pointing to areas of strong market presence and potential growth markets.
